## API Base URL

The services are configured to use the deployed backend:
```
http://mohamedexfs60-001-site1.mtempurl.com/api
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { authService, courseService, adminService } from './services';

// Authentication
const user = await authService.login({ email, password });

// Courses
const courses = await courseService.getCourses();

// Admin operations
const stats = await adminService.getPlatformStats();
